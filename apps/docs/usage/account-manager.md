# Account Manager

The account manager is shown as a purple V.

On macOS, it is shown on top of the screen, and on Windows, it is shown in the system tray.

Options are available to open a new window or to create a new window under a specific account, with the ability to login to some server.

::: warning

Accounts are stored in plaintext json under `Documents/Vexed/accounts.json` where you can edit them manually as needed.
