Most of the Flash-related code (basically everything) is derived from:

- [Skua](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Skua)
- [Grimlite-Li](https://github.com/Froztt13/Grimlite-Li/tree/main)

The scripting API aims to be similar to that of Skua, but provide the simplicity and stability that grimlite-li provides.

The grimlite-li loader is specifically used for this reason.
