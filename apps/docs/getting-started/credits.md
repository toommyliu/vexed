# Credits

A lot of the Flash code is derived from the following projects:

- [Grimlite Li](https://github.com/Froztt13/Grimlite-Li/)/[Grimlite Rev](https://github.com/GentleGanku/GrimliteRev)
- [Skua](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Skua)

Most of the ui is heavily inspired by Grimlite, so you'll probably see a lot of similarities there. Furthermore, some of the scripting code are also derived from them, too.
