# Compiling

## Prerequisities

1. [Node.js / npm](https://nodejs.org/en) AND [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

::: info
Any modern version of Node.js should work fine. As long as its LTS or higher, you'll probably be ok.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository (`git clone`)
2. Install dependencies (`pnpm i`)

## **Project Structure (Monorepo)**

- **`apps/as3`**: Game loader
- **`apps/docs`**: Website and documentation
- **`apps/electron`**: Desktop application

### Game Loader / ActionScript

The following steps are only required if you want to modify and compile the game loader swf file.

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of your guide:

1. **Install Homebrew (Optional)**

   Used to install `openjdk`.

   Skip if you install `openjdk` another way.

2. **Install `openjdk`**

   - Add `openjdk` to your PATH:
     ```bash
     echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/include"
     ```
   - Restart your terminal and confirm with:
     ```bash
     java --version
     ```

3. **Install Flash SDK**

   - Download the [Moonshine SDK Installer](https://moonshine-ide.com/download-sdk-installer/).
   - Use it to install **Apache Flex SDK (Harman AIR)** to your Downloads folder.

4. **Set Up VSCode**
   - Install the [ActionScript extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bowlerhatllc.vscode-as3mxml).
   - Open the command palette (CMD+SHIFT+P) > **ActionScript: Select Workspace SDK** > **Add SDK** (choose your SDK directory).
   - Test by compiling an ActionScript file (CMD+SHIFT+B) > **ActionScript: Compile Release**.


### Documentation App

1. Install dependencies (`pnpm i`)
2. Run the development server (`pnpm dev`)

To build: `pnpm build`

### Electron App

- **Renderer**: Handles anything the user interacts with (think ui/ux)

- **Main**: Handles internal processes

- **Game**: Refers to a game window

- **Manager**: Refers to the account manager window

## Development (Electron)

Run a dev script using `pnpm dev` in the `apps/electron` directory first. This runs the typechecker, transpiler, and starts the electron app.

If you make changes to a main process file, you will need to hard restart the app.

Otherwise, you can refresh the window (CMD+SHIFT+R) and should see your changes.

You can also use a watch script `pnpm dev:watch` which might be more convenient.

## Compiling

Run `pnpm build` to build binaries for the current platform, or `pnpm build:all` to build binaries for all supported platforms.
