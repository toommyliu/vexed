# Downloading

## Downloading

Downloading Vexed is simple.

Visit [the releases page](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/releases) and find the latest release. This will usually be the biggest number, or the one with the "Latest" badge.

Download the aptly named zip file for your platform.

Since it comes as a portable application/executable, you can extract it wherever.

## Running the app

### macOS

When running Vexed for the first time, you may see a warning regarding "Apple cannot check it for malicious software." To solve this, click OK then open Finder, find the Application file and CTRL+CLICK the icon and press Open.

> [!NOTE]
> This warning only appears for Mac users because the application is not signed. If it were to signed, it would cost money.

You may also be prompted to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527), do so. Rosetta may be difficult to uninstall, but you shouldn't ever need to, especially if you continue to use x64 apps on your Apple Silicon machine.

### Windows

No further steps should be required. Create an issue if this is not the case.

## Updating

Unfortunately, all updates must be manually downloaded.
