# Downloading

## Downloading

Downloading Vexed is simple.

Visit [the releases page](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/releases) and find the latest release. This will usually be the biggest number.

Download the `Vexed.zip` file.

You can choose to extract the application to the Applications folder, or place it wherever, it doesn't matter.

When running Vexed for the first time, you may see a warning regarding "Apple cannot check it for malicious software." To solve this, click OK then open Finder, find the Application file and CTRL+CLICK the icon and press Open.

You may also be prompted to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527), do so.

> [!NOTE]
> This is necessary for the app to run since Flash does not support Apple Silicon.


You may also be prompted to allow Vexed to access the Documents folder, do so.

> [!NOTE]
This is necessary to store your accounts (Account Manager), preferences, and scripts.
