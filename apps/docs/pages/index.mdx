Vexed is a scripting client for AQW, specifically for macOS users.

It's been tested on Apple Silicon and works through the power of Rosetta; untested on Intel. In the future, the goal is to use Ruffle
to emulate Flash: see [#4](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/pull/4).

## Usage

Currently, the only way to use Vexed is by compiling the source yourself.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with **yarn**
    - If you try other package managers (npm, pnpm, bun), you may encounter further issues
3. Run the build script
