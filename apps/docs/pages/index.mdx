## about

Vexed is a scripting client for AQW, specifically for macOS users.

tested specifically on Apple Silicon, but it should work on Intel environments, too.

in the future, the goal is to have it run as an universal app; see [#4](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/pull/4)

## usage

currently, the only way to use vexed is by compiling the source yourself.

if you have some js/node knowledge. you can simply:

1. clone the repo
2. install dependencies
3. run build script
    - the package.json scripts use bun, use npm if you prefer.
	- the build script may complain about git and node not being installed, install them too.

in the future, builds will be distributed through github releases.
