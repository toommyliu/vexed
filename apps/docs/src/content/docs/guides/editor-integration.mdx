import { Code, FileTree, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const jsConfig = `
{
  "include": ["bots/**/*", "commands.d.ts"]
}
`;

Constantly switching between your code editor and documentation to check available commands can disrupt your workflow. You can streamline this by integrating type definitions directly into your editor's language server.

Create a local copy of the [commands.d.ts](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/blob/main/commands.d.ts) file and save it to your documents folder.

Then setup a `jsconfig.json` to include this type definitions file:

<Code code={jsConfig} lang="json" title="jsconfig.json" />

The final result might look something like:

<FileTree>

- documents/vexed/

  - jsconfig.json
  - commands.d.ts
  - â€¦
  - bots/

    - my_bot.js

</FileTree>

<Aside>
  This was tested against Visual Studio Code, but steps should be similar for
  other code editors.

## Caveats

- Typings for [cmd.register_command](/api/misc#cmdregister_command) are awkward, particularly
  `bot` and `ctx` are not included in the Command interface.
