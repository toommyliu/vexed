Effortlessly manage and switch between multiple game accounts, streamling opening multiple clients and logging in at once.

You can open the account manager by clicking the tray icon and selecting **Open Account Manager**.

You can also set the default launch mode for the app by editing `Documents/Vexed/settings.json`.

<Aside type="danger">
  Accounts are stored in plaintext json under `Documents/Vexed/accounts.json`
  where you can edit them manually as needed.
