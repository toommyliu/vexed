# vexed

Cross-platform AQW "commands"-based Scripting Client

## Getting started

Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/releases).

For more information on how to use the app, [head over to the docs](https://aqw-vexed.vercel.app/).

## Alternatives

Windows users who prefer a more mature tool or larger communities may want to explore [Skua](https://github.com/auqw/Skua) or [Grimlite-Li](https://github.com/Froztt13/Grimlite-Li). This project builds on them and their predecessors, and incorporates some of their code and ideas to replicate core functionality.
