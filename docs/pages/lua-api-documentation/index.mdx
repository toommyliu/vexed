currently, the only way to execute lua code is through the dev tools console.

> in the future, better ux will be added to loading lua scripts but this will always be possible in the console.

example:

```js
// prefer to use backticks for multiline snippets

// print the current level
executeLua(`
	print(player:get_level())
`);
```
