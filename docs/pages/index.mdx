## about

arcana is a scripting client for AQW, specifically for macOS users.

tested specifically on Apple Silicon, but it should work on Intel environments, too.

in the future, the goal is to have it run natively: [#4](https://github.com/toommyliu/arcana/pull/4)

## usage

currently, the only way to use Arcana is by compiling the source yourself. 

if you have some js/node knowledge. you can simply:

1. clone the repo
2. install dependencies
3. run build script
    - the package.json scripts use bun, use npm if you prefer.

in the future, builds will be distributed through github.
