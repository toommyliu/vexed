## What is a Skillset?

A skillset is a sequence of skills to use for some class, specifically for the Auto attack feature.

```json
{
  "Legion Revenant": "3;1;2;4|150"
}
```

This describes a skillset for Legion Revenant class. The casing of the class name does not matter.

## Basic Structure

Skillsets are encoded as a string as follows:

- Semicolon (`;`) separates different skills
- Pipe (`|`) terminates the skillset and specifies the delay between skill casts (optional)
- Skills are numbered 0-5
  - 0 = Auto attack (basic attack)
  - 1-4 = Skills 1 through 4
  - 5 = potion / consumable

  Indicies out of the range are ignored.

## Wait for skill

To wait for a skill to be available, use the `W` flag after a skill index. For example:

```

1;2W;3;4

```

This means: use skill 1, wait for skill 2 to be available, then use skills 3 and 4. When waiting for a skill, no other skills get casted.

## Conditions

You can add conditions to skills using a colon (`:`) after the skill number.

### HP Conditions

Use `SH` (Safe HP) followed by a comparison:

```json
1:SH>60;2;3;4:SH>30
```

Use skill 1 if hp is greater than 60%, use skill 2, use skill 3, use skill 4 if hp is greater than 30%.

### MP conditions

Use `SM` (Safe MP) followed by a comparison:

```json
1:SM>60;2;3;4:SM>30
```

### Comparison Operators

- `>` = greater than
- `<` = less than
- `>=` = greater than or equal to
- `<=` = less than or equal to

### Chaining with Wait

```
1W:SH<40;2;3;4
```

Wait for skill 1 to be available to use but only if HP is below 40%, then use skills 2, 3, and 4.
