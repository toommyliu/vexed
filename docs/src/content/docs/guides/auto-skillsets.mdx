## What is a Skillset?

A skillset is a sequence of skills to use for some class, specifically for the Auto attack feature.

```json
{
  "Legion Revenant": {
    "skills": [3, 4, 1, 2],
    "delay": 150
  }
}
```

This describes a skillset for Legion Revenant class. The casing of the class name does not matter.

## Basic Structure

Skillsets are stored as JSON objects with the following properties:

- `skills` - An array of skills to execute in order (can be numbers or objects)
- `delay` - Optional delay in milliseconds between skill casts (default: 150)

Skills can be:
- **Numbers** - Just the skill index (e.g., `3`) for simple skills
- **Objects** - Full skill objects for advanced features (wait, conditions)

Skill indices:
- 0 = Auto attack (basic attack)
- 1-4 = Skills 1 through 4
- 5 = potion / consumable

Indices out of the 0-5 range are ignored.

## Wait for skill

To wait for a skill to be available before casting, add `"wait": true`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "index": 1 },
    { "index": 2, "wait": true },
    { "index": 3 },
    { "index": 4 }
  ]
}
```

This means: use skill 1, wait for skill 2 to be available, then use skills 3 and 4. When waiting for a skill, no other skills get casted.

## Conditions

You can add conditions to skills to only cast them when HP or MP meets a threshold.

### HP Conditions

Use a `condition` object with `"type": "hp"`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "index": 1, "condition": { "type": "hp", "operator": ">", "value": 60 } },
    { "index": 2 },
    { "index": 3 },
    { "index": 4, "condition": { "type": "hp", "operator": ">", "value": 30 } }
  ]
}
```

Use skill 1 if HP is greater than 60%, use skill 2, use skill 3, use skill 4 if HP is greater than 30%.

### MP Conditions

Use a `condition` object with `"type": "mp"`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "index": 1, "condition": { "type": "mp", "operator": ">", "value": 60 } },
    { "index": 2 },
    { "index": 3 },
    { "index": 4, "condition": { "type": "mp", "operator": ">", "value": 30 } }
  ]
}
```

### Comparison Operators

- `>` = greater than
- `<` = less than
- `>=` = greater than or equal to
- `<=` = less than or equal to

### Combining Wait with Conditions

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "index": 1, "wait": true, "condition": { "type": "hp", "operator": "<", "value": 40 } },
    { "index": 2 },
    { "index": 3 },
    { "index": 4 }
  ]
}
```

Wait for skill 1 to be available to use but only if HP is below 40%, then use skills 2, 3, and 4.

## Examples

```json
{
  // Simple: just skill indices
  "Legion Revenant": {
    "skills": [3, 4, 1, 2]
  },

  // With delay between skills (100ms)
  "Void Highlord": {
    "skills": [2, 3, 5, 4, 1],
    "delay": 100
  },

  // Wait for skill 1 before casting
  "Chaos Avenger": {
    "skills": [
      { "index": 1, "wait": true },
      2,
      3,
      4
    ]
  },

  // Only use skill 3 if HP > 70%
  "Dragon of Time": {
    "skills": [
      { "index": 3, "condition": { "type": "hp", "operator": ">", "value": 70 } },
      2,
      4,
      1
    ]
  },

  // Only use skill 2 if MP >= 40%
  "Lightcaster": {
    "skills": [
      1,
      { "index": 2, "condition": { "type": "mp", "operator": ">=", "value": 40 } },
      3,
      4
    ],
    "delay": 150
  },

  // Wait for skill 4 AND only if HP < 50%
  "Chrono Assassin": {
    "skills": [
      { "index": 4, "wait": true, "condition": { "type": "hp", "operator": "<", "value": 50 } },
      2,
      3,
      1
    ]
  }
}
```

## Migration from Old Format

If you have skillsets in the old string format (e.g., `"3;4;1;2|150"`), use the [Skillset Migration Tool](/tools/skillset-migration.html) to convert them to the new JSON format.
