import { Code, Steps, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const sampleConfig = String.raw`
PlayerCount: 4
RoomNumber: 12345
Player1: my_player_name1
Player2: my_player_name2
Player3: my_player_name3
Player4: my_player_name4
`;

Armying is for advanced use cases!

## Setting up the config

A config file is required for armying. A sample config might look like:

<Code code={sampleConfig} lang="txt" title="config.txt" />

There is no imposed value for player countâ€”as long as PlayerCount is set, it will look for that many players.
The assumption is made that Player1 acts as the leader.

### Specification

<Steps>

1. PlayerCount must be provided

   This way, vexed knows how many players to look out for.

2. RoomNumber must be provided

   This way, vexed knows which room number to join.

3. Item names

   Share the same itemset across all account, along with enchants to streamline equipping sets.

   For example, `Dauntless:Necrotic Sword of Doom`.

   <Aside>In the future, simpler mechanics may be provided for this.</Aside>

4. Comments

   Use # at beginning of lines to ignore. Blank lines will also be ignored.

</Steps>

## Writing army scripts

The idea of an army script is one-script that is loaded across all players but will have slight variations in functionality to accomodate the current player.

### Requirements

Army scripts must have the following commands:

<Steps>

1. [cmd.army_set_config()](/api/army#cmdarmy_set_config)

   The name to the config file (under `Documents/vexed/Storage`).

2. [cmd.army_init()](/api/army#cmdarmy_init)

   Begins loading the config and other internal behaviors. Ideally, these commands are called ASAP.

</Steps>

Army scripts should use army-variants of normal commands where possible.

<Aside variant="tip">
  Use [cmd.execute_with_army](/api/army#cmdexecute_with_army) to write custom
  actions using internal APIs.
