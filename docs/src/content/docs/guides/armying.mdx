Armying is for advanced use cases!

## Configuration

A config file is required for armying. A sample config might look like:

<Code code={sampleConfig} lang="txt" title="config.txt" />

There is no imposed value for player countâ€”as long as PlayerCount is set, it will look for that many players.
The assumption is made that Player1 acts as the leader.

### Specification

<Steps>

1. PlayerCount

   This way, vexed knows how many players to look out for.

2. RoomNumber

   This way, vexed knows which room number to join.

3. Comments

   Use # at beginning of lines to ignore. Blank lines will also be ignored.

</Steps>

### Sets

We will define sets using the boss name.

<Code code={sampleConfigSets} lang="txt" title="config.txt" />

The set name is defined as `UltraNulgath`, and the individual items are associated with their player number. Sets can also include `Pet`.

Use sets with the [cmd.army_equip_set](/api/army#cmdarmy_equip_set) command.

## Writing army scripts

The idea of an army script is one-script that is loaded across all players but will have slight variations in functionality to accomodate the current player.

### Requirements

Army scripts must have the following commands:

<Steps>

1. [cmd.army_set_config()](/api/army#cmdarmy_set_config)

   The name to the config file (under `Documents/vexed/Storage`).

2. [cmd.army_init()](/api/army#cmdarmy_init)

   Begins loading the config and other internal behaviors. Ideally, these commands are called ASAP.

</Steps>

Army scripts should use army-variants of normal commands where possible.

<Aside variant="tip">
  Use [cmd.execute_with_army](/api/army#cmdexecute_with_army) to write custom
  actions using internal APIs. You could also use [cmd.register_command]() too.
