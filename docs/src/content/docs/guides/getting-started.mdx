import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Downloading

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/releases).

Select the correct file for your platform.

## Running the app

### macOS

When running the app for the first time, you might see a warning saying **vexed cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software**. This happens because the app isn't signed with an Apple developer certificate.

See [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/apple-cant-check-app-for-malicious-software-mchleab3a043/mac) for more details.

#### Newer macOS versions (Sonoma and later)

1. Open **System Settings**, then click **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to **Security**, then click **Open**
3. Click **Open Anyway**
4. Enter your login password, then click OK.

#### Older versions (Ventura and older)

1. In **Finder**, locate the app (don't use Launchpad)
2. **Control-click** the app icon, then choose **Open** from the shortcut menu
3. Click **Open**

It might also prompt you to install Rosetta 2, which is required to run x86_64 apps on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Windows

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will stop the app from running when you first try to open it.

1. Click **More info** when the SmartScreen warning appears
2. Click **Run anyway**

<Aside>
  These warnings are only a result of the app not being signed, which costs
  money. They only show the first time you run the app anyways.
