## Downloading

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/toommyliu/vexed/releases).

Select the correct file for your platform.

## Running the app

### macOS

When running the app for the first time, you might see a warning saying **vexed cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software**. This happens because the app isn't signed with an Apple developer certificate. To run the app:

1. Click **OK** to dismiss the initial warning
2. Open **Finder** and locate the app
3. Hold **Control (âŒƒ)** and click the app icon
4. Select **Open** from the context menu
5. Click **Open** in the dialog that appears

It might also prompt you to install Rosetta 2, which is required to run x86_64 apps on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Windows

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will stop the app from running when you first try to open it.

1. Click **More info** when the SmartScreen warning appears
2. Click **Run anyway**

<Aside>
  These warnings are only a result of the app not being signed, which costs
  money. They only show the first time you run the app anyways.
