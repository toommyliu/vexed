import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisities

1. [Node.js / npm](https://nodejs.org/en) AND [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

<Aside>Any modern version of Node.js should suffice (LTS or above).</Aside>

## Project Layout

vexed consists of three core codebases.

### Actionscript

We recommend using VSCode for ActionScript development. Decompilers like JPEXS work but lack good developer experience (in our experience, atleast). Plus, we aren't aware of any modern tooling for Actionscript besides in VSCode.

#### Prerequisites

1. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)
2. [Flash SDK](https://moonshine-ide.com/download-sdk-installer/)
3. [ActionScript Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bowlerhatllc.vscode-as3mxml)

<Steps>
1. Select ActionScript SDK
  In VSCode, execute the command **ActionScript: Select Workspace SDK**, where you find the path to the **Apache Flex SDK (Harman AIR)** install.

2. Test Compilation
   Demo compilation by opening an Actionscript file and executing **ActionScript: Compile Release/Debug**

</Steps>

### Setup

1. Install dependencies at project root: **pnpm i**

### Documentation

1. Navigate to docs folder: **cd docs**

2. Start the documentation in dev mode: **pnpm dev**

### Electron app

1. Navigate to app folder: **cd app**

2. Start the app in dev mode: **pnpm dev** or **pnpm dev:watch**
